# Postman MCP Server

The Postman MCP Server connects Postman to AI tools, giving AI agents and assistants the ability to access workspaces, manage collections and environments, evaluate APIs, and automate workflows through natural language interactions.

Postman supports the following tool configurations:

- **Minimal** — (Default) Only includes essential tools for basic Postman operations This offers faster performance and simplifies use for those who only need basic Postman operations. Ideal for users who want to modify a single Postman elements, such as collections, workspaces, or environments.
- **Full** — Includes all available Postman API tools (100+ tools). This configuration is ideal for users who engage in advanced collaboration and Postman's Enterprise features.

### Use Cases

- **Code synchronization** - Effortlessly keep your code in sync with your Postman collections and specs.
- **Collection management** - Create and tag collections, update collection and request documentation, add comments, or perform actions across multiple collections without leaving your editor.
- **Workspace and environment management** - Create workspaces and environments, plus manage your environment variables.
- **Automatic spec creation** - Create [specs](https://learning.postman.com/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/) from your code and use them to generate Postman collections.

Designed for developers who want to integrate their AI tools with Postman’s context and features. Supports quick natural language queries queries to advanced agent workflows.

### Support for EU

The Postman MCP Server supports the EU region for remote and local servers:
- For streamable HTTP, the remote server is available at `https://mcp.eu.postman.com`.
- For our STDIO public package, use the `--region` flag to specify the Postman API region (`us` or `eu`), or set the `POSTMAN_API_BASE_URL` environment variable directly.

## Remote server

The remote Postman MCP Server is hosted by Postman over streamable HTTP and provides the easiest method for getting started. If your MCP host doesn't support remote MCP servers, you can use the [local Postman MCP Server](#local-server).

The remote server supports the following tool configurations:

- **Minimal** — (Default) Only includes essential tools for basic Postman operations, available at `https://mcp.postman.com/minimal`.
- **Full** — Includes all available Postman API tools (100+ tools), available at `https://mcp.postman.com/mcp`.

**Note:** The remote EU HTTP server is available at `https://mcp.eu.postman.com`.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make certain you have a valid [Postman API Key](https://postman.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).

### Install in VS Code

#### Manual configuration

To manually configure the remote Postman MCP Server in VS Code, add the following JSON block to the *.vscode/mcp.json* file:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "postman-api-http-server": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://mcp.postman.com/{minimal | mcp}", // use "minimal" (default) or "mcp" (full)
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:postman-api-key}"
            }
        }
    },
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "postman-api-key",
            "type": "promptString",

## Local server

If remote MCP servers aren't supported by your MCP host, you can install the Postman MCP Server to your local machine.

STDIO is a lightweight solution that's ideal for integration with editors and tools like Visual Studio Code. Install an MCP-compatible VS Code extension, such as GitHub Copilot, Claude for VS Code, or other AI assistants that support MCP.

[![Install GitHub Copilot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install-GitHub%20Copilot-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](vscode:extension/GitHub.copilot) [![Install Claude for VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install-Claude%20for%20VS%20Code-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=anthropic)](vscode:extension/Anthropic.claude-dev)

**Note:** For Docker set up and installation, see [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md).

The local server supports the following tool configurations:

- **Minimal** — (Default) Only includes essential tools for basic Postman operations.
- **Full** — Includes all available Postman API tools (100+ tools). Use the `--full` flag to enable this configuration.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need the following:

1. To run the server as a Node application, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
1. A valid [Postman API Key](https://postman.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).

### Configuration

To configure the extension to use the local Postman MCP Server, do the following:

1. Clone the **postman-mcp-server** repository.
1. In the repository's root folder, run the `npm install` command. This installs all the required dependencies.
1. Replace `${workspaceFolder}` in the *mcp.json* file with the full path to the Postman MCP repository.
1. When prompted, enter your Postman API key.

    "servers": {
        "postman-api-mcp": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "@postman/postman-mcp-server",
                "--full" // (optional) Use this flag to enable full mode
            ],
            "env": {
                "POSTMAN_API_KEY": "${input:postman-api-key}"
            }
        }
    },
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "postman-api-key",
            "type": "promptString",
